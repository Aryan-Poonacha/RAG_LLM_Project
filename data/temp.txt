Abstract

Background/objective: FKB327 is a biosimilar of the adalimumab reference product (RP). The primary objective
was to assess the relative bioavailability of FKB327 after a single subcutaneous (SC) dose via prefilled syringe (PFS),
auto-injector (AI), or vial with a disposable syringe (vial), in healthy subjects.
Methods: This randomized, open-label, parallel-group, single SC-dose study was conducted in 195 healthy male
and female subjects who were randomized 1:1:1 to receive FKB327 40 mg via PFS, AI, or vial. The primary
pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters, areas under the serum concentration-time curve to the last detectable value
(AUC0-t) and extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞), and maximum concentration (Cmax), were compared. Relative
bioavailability was established if the ratio of geometric least squares (LS) means of the test product was within the
predefined bioequivalence (BE) range of 0.80 to 1.25 of the RP for each comparison. Safety and immunogenicity
were assessed.
Results: The mean serum FKB327 concentration-time profiles appeared similar across all 3 presentations. AUC0-t,
AUC0-∞, and Cmax were within the predefined BE range for PFS compared with vial, suggesting comparable
bioavailability. AUC0-∞ and Cmax of AI compared with vial and PFS were fully contained within BE range, although
the upper limit of 90% confidence intervals of the geometric LS means ratios for AUC0-t was slightly high.
Treatment-emergent adverse events in all 3 groups were mild, with no new safety concern with FKB327 identified.
Similar immunogenicity was observed among administrations.
Conclusion: Among all 3 delivery methods, PK characteristics, safety profiles, and immunogenicity were similar.

Background
Adalimumab is a recombinant, human immunoglobulin
G1 monoclonal antibody specific for human tumor ne-
crosis factor–alpha (TNF-α) that was originally approved
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the United
States in December 2002 and in the European Union in
September 2003, and is marketed under the brand name
Humira® [1, 2]. Humira was subsequently approved in
the United States for juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psori-
atic arthritis, ankylosing arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and
plaque psoriasis [1]. In the European Union, Humira
was approved for adult and pediatric Crohn’s disease, ju-
venile idiopathic arthritis, adult and pediatric plaque
psoriasis, and adult and pediatric uveitis [2]. Analysis of
clinical trial safety data and postmarketing surveillance
data demonstrates that long-term treatment with adali-
mumab is generally safe and well-tolerated [3].

Patent restrictions for adalimumab have begun to ex-
pire. FKB327 is a biosimilar of Humira (adalimumab)
[4]. Biosimilar agents are not generic forms of reference
biological products. Unlike generic drugs, which are
identical copies of the reference drug with the same
pharmacologic effects and safety profile, biosimilars are
products highly similar to the reference biologic agent
but not identical [5]. Thus, whereas generic drugs can be
approved on the basis of bioequivalence (BE) to the ref-
erence drug, the same is not true for the approval of bio-
similars [6]. Regulatory considerations for biosimilars are
continuing to evolve in the United States and European
Union as a result of the distinct challenges of manufac-
turing biosimilars [7]. The US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA)
have both developed guidance regarding the approval of
biosimilars [7]. The EMA guidance details product-
specific approval pathways based on biological classifica-
tion. In contrast, the FDA currently utilizes a risk-based,
case-by-case, totality-of-evidence approach. To receive
approval, a potential biosimilar must demonstrate simi-
larity to the reference biologic via a stepwise approach
that
includes both structural and functional studies,
nonclinical evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK) and tox-
icity, and clinical assessment of PK, efficacy, and safety,
including immunogenicity [6]. FKB327 was approved by
the EMA in September 2018 and subsequently launched.
FKB327 has not yet received FDA approval.

A recent

randomized, double-blind, parallel-group
study in healthy volunteers compared the PK, safety, tol-
erability, and immunogenicity of FKB327 with those of
EU-approved Humira and US-licensed Humira [4]. Re-
sults from this study showed FKB327 to be well toler-
ated, with a safety profile similar to both Humira
formulations. In addition, the PK of FKB327 were dem-
onstrated to be similar to EU-Humira and US-Humira.
Finally, the prevalence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs)

and the elimination half-life of adalimumab were similar
following administration of all 3 drugs.

The primary objective of this study was to assess the
relative bioavailability of a subcutaneous (SC) dose of
FKB327 administered via a prefilled syringe (PFS), a
prefilled autoinjector (AI), or a vial with a disposable
syringe (vial). Secondary objectives were to compare the
safety of FKB327 across the 3 methods of administration
and to evaluate the effect of body weight and injection
site on the PK of FKB327.

Methods
This study was conducted at the Covance Clinical Re-
search Unit (CRU) in Leeds, United Kingdom. The study
was not initiated until after the Medicines and Health-
care products Regulatory Agency had issued a Clinical
Trial Authorisation, and the informed consent
form
(ICF) and protocol were reviewed and approved by the
ethics committee (National Research Ethics Service
Committee North East – York).

Subjects
Subjects were healthy males and females of any ethnic
origin, aged 18 to 64 years, with a body mass index
(BMI) of 18.0 kg/m2 to 30.0 kg/m2. Subjects were ex-
cluded if they had previously received adalimumab. All
195 subjects enrolled in the study provided written
consent after they were informed about the study and
potential risks. Potential subjects were deemed healthy
following medical history and an examination that in-
cluded a tuberculosis test, vital signs, electrocardiog-
raphy (ECG), and routine laboratory safety tests. All
subjects were tested for drugs of abuse, and female
subjects were tested for pregnancy. Male and female
subjects of childbearing potential agreed to practice birth
control from the time of dose administration until 5
months afterward. Strenuous exercise, alcohol, caffeine,
and concomitant medication were restricted during the
study and subjects were instructed not to smoke for 1 h
prior to each blood pressure and pulse measurement.

Design
This was a randomized, open-label, parallel-group study of
a single SC 40-mg in 0.8 mL dose of FKB327 in healthy
subjects to compare the relative bioavailability (assessed by
PK parameters), safety, and immunogenicity of FKB327
administered via PFS, AI, or vial. A parallel-group study
design was chosen, because adalimumab has a long elimin-
ation half-life and a crossover design would substantially
increase the duration of the study. Furthermore, a cross-
over design was not considered appropriate to confirm PK
characteristics in the present study, because in a previous
phase 1 study comparing the PK characteristics of FKB327,
EU-Humira, and US-Humira, ADAs were detected in

Bush et al. BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology           (2019) 20:87

approximately 70% of subjects across all treatment groups
[4]. Subjects were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive 40 mg
of FKB327 administered with a PFS, AI, or vial. Subjects
were further randomized to treatment groups by weight
strata (50–75 kg and > 75–100 kg) and injection-site strata
(abdomen and thigh). Subjects were randomized to allocate
approximately equal numbers from each stratum across
treatment groups.

Subjects were screened within 28 days of dosing and
were admitted to the CRU 1 day prior to dosing. Partici-
pants resided at the CRU until 24 h postdose. Subjects
then returned for outpatient visits on days 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 51, and 65. Poststudy assessments
were performed at the final outpatient visit.

Assessments
Blood samples for serum drug concentration were taken
prior to dosing and at 4, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168, 192,
360, 528, 696, 864, 1032, 1200, and 1536 h. Serum concen-
trations of FKB327 were determined using a validated im-
munoassay on an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) detection
platform with a 96-well Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) bare
(high-bind) plate, which was coated with TNF-α. A
100-ng/mL lower limit of reliable quantification was used.
Safety assessments were performed after a subject
signed the ICF and then routinely up to and including
the subjects’ final visit. Adverse events (AEs) were moni-
tored during the course of the study through observation
and open-ended questioning. Any reported AEs were re-
corded, along with any subsequent action, if required.
Participants underwent assessments that included blood
pressure, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, physical
examination, laboratory safety tests of blood and urine,
and 12-lead ECG.

Blood samples to assess immunogenicity via the pres-
ence of ADAs were taken prior to dosing and at 360,
696, and 1536 h. The presence of ADAs was determined
by a validated immunoassay on an ECL detection plat-
form with MSD plates to detect against FKB327. Sam-
ples with percent inhibition values greater than a certain
cut point were confirmed positive for the presence of
adalimumab antibodies.

Sample size and statistical methods
Sample size calculations were performed using nQuery
Advisor 7.0, assuming the PK parameters, area under the
serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to time t
(AUC0-t), area under
the serum concentration-time
curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC0-∞), and maximum
serum drug concentration (Cmax), were the primary end
points. The intersubject variability was assumed to be
40%, and considering 80% statistical power and early-
withdrawal subjects, a total of 189 subjects were ex-
pected to be enrolled for the 90% confidence interval

(CI) for the ratio of geometric means of each compari-
son (PFS/vial, AI/vial, and AI/PFS) to fall within the ac-
ceptance criteria of 0.80 to 1.25. Because there were 3
treatment comparisons, overall power was lower than
80%; however, it was not significantly so, as the 3 tests
for bioavailability are highly correlated.

Formal statistical analysis for relative bioavailability
was performed on the PK data to test whether the main
parameters met the predefined criteria, which was set
with reference to a standard BE study [8, 9]. In the as-
sessment of relative bioavailability, 3 comparisons were
made (test product:reference product)—FKB327 PFS:
FKB327 vial, FKB327 AI:FKB327 vial, and FKB327 AI:
FKB327 PFS. The primary hypothesis was that FKB327
delivered via a vial, PFS, or AI would result in similar
bioavailability based on the BE analysis of the geometric
least squares (LS) means of AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax.
The secondary hypothesis was that FKB327 delivered via
a vial, PFS, or AI would result in similar bioavailability,
based on the same analysis as the primary hypothesis for
the geometric LS means of elimination half-life (t1/2) and
maximum concentration (tmax). For each comparison,
the test product was considered to demonstrate BE to
the reference product (RP) if the ratio of the geometric
LS means for the test product relative to the RP were
contained within the 90% CI of 0.80 to 1.25.

The PK parameters of AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, Cmax, and t1/2
were log transformed prior to analysis and were analyzed
using a fixed-effects analysis of variance (ANOVA). The
model included treatment as a fixed effect. For these pa-
rameters, LS means were calculated for the test product
and RP. Mean differences between the test product and
RP were calculated. The residual variance from the model
was used to calculate 90% CI for the difference between
the test product and RP. These values were back-
transformed to give geometric LS means, a point estimate,
and 90% CI for the ratio of the test product relative to the
RP. This procedure is equivalent to Schuirmann’s two
one-sided tests at the 0.05 level of significance.

The PK parameter of tmax was analyzed nonparametri-
cally using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with the median
of the difference of tmax between treatments and the ap-
proximate 90% CIs for the difference presented. A sec-
ondary analysis was conducted to investigate the effect
of adding body weight and injection-site strata into the
ANOVA model,
individually and in combination, as
fixed effects. All remaining data were summarized using
descriptive statistics. The analysis was performed using
SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC).

Results
Subjects
A total of 195 subjects were randomized in the study: 66
to FKB327 vial, 63 to FKB327 PFS, and 66 to FKB327

AI. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. Sub-
jects were comprised of 145 males and 50 females, with
the majority of subjects being white. Demographic char-
acteristics were generally similar among the 3 groups,
with the exception of race; there were more black sub-
jects in the AI group (13.6%) than in the vial (3.0%) and
PFS (1.6%) groups. For the weight strata, 95 subjects
were in the 50- to 75-kg body weight stratum and 100
were in the > 75- to 100-kg body weight stratum.

Pharmacokinetics
A total of 194 subjects were included in the PK analysis.
In the AI treatment group, 1 subject was excluded
because of receiving only a partial dose of the study
drug. A summary of the PK parameters for each group
is provided in Table 2. Mean serum concentration-time
profiles of FKB327 were similar following a single SC
40-mg dose of FKB327 administered via vial, PFS, and
AI (Fig. 1). FKB327 was absorbed slowly across all 3
methods of administration, with a median tmax of
120.03 h, 120.0 h, and 144.0 h in the vial, PFS, and AI
groups, respectively.

A summary of the relative bioavailability analysis is
shown in Table 3. Regarding the primary hypothesis, all
primary PK parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax)
were contained within the predefined BE range for PFS
compared with vial, suggesting comparable bioavailabil-
ity. For the AI/vial and AI/PFS comparisons, the 90%
CIs were fully contained within the BE range for
AUC0-∞ and Cmax; however, the upper limits for AUC0-t
were slightly outside the BE limit of 0.80 to 1.25 (1.11
[0.976, 1.254] and 1.11 [0.981, 1.26], respectively). The

secondary PK parameter of t1/2 was contained within the
range for all 3 comparisons, as the 90% CIs for t1/2 were
fully contained within the BE range.

The secondary analysis of PK parameters by body
weight showed a tendency for greater exposure in the
50- to 75-kg group compared with the > 75- to 100-kg
group. In the 50- to 75-kg group, the geometric LS mean
for AUC0-t was 2,370,000, 2,470,000, and 2,790,000 h*ng/
mL, and the geometric LS mean for Cmax was 3770,
4010, and 4110 ng/mL for the vial, PFS, and AI groups,
respectively. In the > 75- to 100-kg group, the geometric
LS mean for AUC0-t was 1,960,000, 1,860,000, and 2,040,
000 h*ng/mL and the geometric LS mean for Cmax was
3180, 2980, and 3150 ng/mL for the vial, PFS, and AI
groups, respectively.

The secondary analysis of PK parameters by injection
site showed a tendency for lower exposure in the ab-
dominal group than in the thigh group. In the abdom-
inal group, the geometric LS mean for AUC0-t was 1,
890,000, 202,000, and 2,350,000 h*ng/mL, and the geo-
metric LS mean for Cmax was 3100, 3150, and 3450 ng/
mL for the vial, PFS, and AI groups, respectively. In the
thigh group, the geometric LS mean for AUC0-t was 2,
450,000, 2,270,000, and 2,410,000 h*ng/mL and the geo-
metric LS mean for Cmax was 3860, 3790, and 3730 ng/
mL for the vial, PFS, and AI groups, respectively.

When body weight and injection-site strata (individu-
ally and in combination) were added as fixed effects into
the analysis model, all primary PK parameters (AUC0-t,
AUC0-∞, and Cmax) were contained within the prede-
fined BE range for PFS and AI compared with vial. In

addition, AUC0-∞ and Cmax were within the range for
the comparison between PFS and AI. The upper limit of
90% CIs of the geometric LS means ratios for AUC0-t
were slightly outside the predefined limit (1.11 [0.987,
1.26], 1.11 [0.980, 1.26], and 1.11 [0.986, 1.251] for body
weight strata, injection-site strata, and body weight and
injection-site strata combined, respectively).

of subjects in the vial group showed positive ADA activ-
ity (78.8%) compared with the PFS (54.0%) and AI
groups (62.1%). The proportion of subjects with positive
ADA activity at subsequent
time points was nearly
equal. At hour 1536, the percentage of subjects with
positive ADA activity was 100% for the vial and PFS
groups, and 98.5% for the AI group.

Immunogenicity
The frequency of ADAs is shown in Table 4. The per-
centage of subjects with positive ADA status at predose
was disproportionate, with 21.2, 19.0, and 10.6% of sub-
jects showing positive ADA activity in the vial, PFS, and
AI groups, respectively. At hour 360, a higher percentage

considered mild. The most commonly reported TEAE
for all 3 groups was nasopharyngitis, which occurred in
21.2, 23.8, and 30.3% of subjects in the vial, PFS, and AI
groups, respectively. The second most commonly re-
ported TEAE was headache, which occurred in 10.6 and
14.3% of subjects in the vial and PFS groups, respect-
ively, compared with 3.0% in AI group.

Of all the TEAEs, 53.8% were deemed possibly related
to the study drug and 3.6% were deemed related to the
study drug, whereas 3.1% were considered possibly re-
lated to the study device. There were no serious AEs
and no discontinuations due to TEAEs. The overall inci-
dence of TEAEs was similar in the vial and PFS groups
(60.6 and 58.7%, respectively), and slightly higher in the
AI group (72.7%). The higher TEAE rate in the AI group
was accounted for by a greater incidence of nasopharyn-
gitis, injection-site rash, vessel puncture–site pain, and
vessel puncture–site bruise.

A total of 4 subjects had laboratory results of potential
clinical importance. Increases in transaminases deemed

TEAE. There were no clinically meaningful findings in
vital signs or 12-lead ECGs for any subjects during the
study.

Discussion
In this study, we sought to confirm the similar bioavail-
ability of FKB327 whether delivered by vial, PFS, or AI,
as assessed using a typical BE range across the PK pa-
rameters of AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax. All primary pa-
rameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax) were contained
within the predefined BE range for PFS compared with
vial, suggesting comparable bioavailability, and AUC0-∞
and Cmax were contained within the BE range in the AI/
vial and AI/PFS comparisons. For the AI/vial and AI/
PFS comparisons, the 90% CIs for AUC0-t were slightly
outside the predefined BE limit. No statistically signifi-
cant difference was found in t1/2 among the 3 methods
of administration.

Analysis of body weight and injection-site strata
showed that exposure for the 50- to 75-kg group was

slightly higher than in the > 75- to 100-kg group as ex-
pected, and the thigh group showed a tendency for
greater exposure than the abdomen group. Based on the
apparent effect of body weight as a categorical fixed ef-
fect, 2 post hoc analyses were performed to explore the
effect of body weight and BMI on the BE of the primary
PK parameters. First, the primary statistical analysis was
repeated with the addition of body weight as a covariate
to the statistical model. Second, the primary statistical
analysis was repeated with the addition of BMI as a
covariate to the statistical model. When body weight
was included as a covariate, the primary PK parame-
ters of AUC0-∞ and Cmax were within the BE range
for PFS and AI compared with vial; however,
the
upper limit of
the geometric LS
means ratios for AUC0-t was slightly outside the BE
range of 0.80 to 1.25. When BMI was included as a covari-
ate, all primary PK parameters (AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and
Cmax) were contained within the predefined BE range for
all 3 methods of administration.

The proportion of subjects with positive ADA activity
at baseline was lower for the AI group (10.6%) than for
the vial (21.2%) and PFS (19.0%) groups, suggesting pos-
sible slight differences in immunogenicity conditions in
the AI group. Due to the imbalance in the ADA-positive
ratio by confirmatory assay at baseline, an additional
post hoc statistical analysis, adjusted by baseline (pre-
dose) ADA status, was performed. When adding baseline
confirmatory ADA status as a fixed effect to the analysis
model, primary PK parameters of AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and
Cmax were fully contained within the predefined BE
range for all 3 methods of administration.

Single SC doses of 40-mg FKB327 were well-tolerated
by healthy male and female subjects whether delivered
by a vial, PFS, or AI. The rate of TEAEs was slightly
higher for the AI group, largely due to higher incidence
of nasopharyngitis, injection-site rash, vessel puncture–
site pain, and vessel puncture–site bruising reported in
this group. The majority of TEAEs in all 3 groups were
of mild severity (94.6%). No severe TEAEs were reported
and no subjects discontinued because of a TEAE. Fur-
thermore, no safety concerns were found based on clin-
ical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and 12-lead ECGs.
The results shown here advance findings from a previ-
ous study of FKB327 in healthy volunteers [4]. Puri and
colleagues reported that FKB327 was well-tolerated, with
a safety profile similar to Humira. Furthermore, the PK
characteristics of FKB327 were similar to both US and
EU formulations of Humira.

delivered across all 3 methods of administration was
highly similar based on the analysis of the PK parame-
ters. The ADA activity and t1/2 of adalimumab were also
similar for all 3 methods of administration. The results
from this study suggest that the delivery of FKB327 with
a vial, PFS, or AI can be used interchangeably in clinical
practice.
